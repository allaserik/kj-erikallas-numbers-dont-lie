## The Situation 👀

Imagine transforming your wellness platform into a personalized nutrition companion that truly understands each user. In this project, you'll expand your wellness platform with AI-powered meal planning and recipe generation. Your app will take user dietary preferences, restrictions, and health goals (established in Project 1) and create customized  **meal plans** , **recipes** and help the user plan and manage their  **nutrition** . You will learn how to **structure prompts** for content generation, **manage complex data relationships** and further refine your AI integration skills. Furthermore, you will learn useful techniques to compensate for the problems commonly associated with LLM's.

## Functional Requirements 📋

The first step to planning nutrition is to understand the user - their personal data, goals, constraints and preferences. You'll expand on and confirm the information already gathered in the previous project in order to create a system that generates daily or weekly meal plans, with accompanying recipes and nutritional values, based on user-provided data and preferences.

### User Preference

Collect and utilize the following information:

* [Dietary preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diets) (vegetarian, keto, etc.)
* [Allergies and intolerances](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens)
* Disliked ingredients
* Cuisine preferences
* Calorie and macronutrient targets
* Meal frequency and timing

Your nutritional planning must support at least 15 different dietary preferences and 10 food allergies/intolerances.

All dates and times throughout the application are required to use ISO 8601 standard.

* This means that users will also need to be able to specify their timezone.

> Don't request information already collected in Project 1. Use AI to suggest defaults when users are uncertain.

### Meal Planning

Create an AI system that generates and manages meal plans that feel like they were crafted by a personal nutritionist. Created AI system must have these functionalities:

* **AI-Powered Generation:**
  * Daily and weekly meal plans with nutritional balance
  * Flexible meal structures (e.g., 3 meals + 2 snacks)
  * Meal details including names, default time (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), and nutritional information
  * Alternative meal suggestions
* **Customization Tools:**
  * Swap generated meals in a plan
  * Manual meal additions
  * Regeneration options for whole meal plan or individual meals
* **Shopping List:**
  * Automated generation from meal plans
  * Ingredient categorization (at least 5 meaningful categories)
  * Ingredient quantity adjustments
  * Option to remove ingredients from shopping list

#### Example Meal Plan Input Structure

```json
{
    "user_preferences": {
        "dietary_restrictions": ["vegetarian", "gluten-free"],
        "cuisine_preferences": ["Italian", "Mexican"],
        "disliked_ingredients": ["mushrooms", "tofu"],
        "calorie_target": 2000,
        "macronutrient_targets": {"protein": 100, "carbs": 200, "fats": 60},
        "meals_per_day": 3,
        "preferred_meal_times": {"breakfast": "2024-01-01T08:00:00Z", "lunch": "2024-01-01T12:30:00Z", "dinner": "2024-01-01T19:00:00Z"}
    },
    "meal_plan_request": {
        "duration": "daily", 
        "date": "2024-07-29",
        "version": "1.0",
        "created_at": "2024-07-28T14:30:00Z"
    }
}
```

## GenAI Techniques

### Sequential Prompting

Creating comprehensive meal plans often requires multiple steps that are difficult to accomplish in a single prompt. [Sequential prompting](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts) allows you to break down complex meal planning into a series of focused steps:

1. **Initial Assessment:** Analyze user profile to define meal plan strategy
2. **Meal Structure:** Design specific meals and timing
3. **Recipe Generation:** Creates detailed recipes
4. **Nutritional Analysis:** Evaluate nutritional balance
5. **Refinement:** Adjust to address nutritional gaps

Your prompt sequence must have at least 3 steps.

**Example flow:**

```json
PROMPT 1: "Analyze this user profile and recommend a meal strategy..."
RESPONSE: [Strategy with macronutrient targets and meal timing]

PROMPT 2: "Based on this strategy, create a meal structure..."
RESPONSE: [Structured meal plan with specific meal types]

PROMPT 3: "Generate a recipe for Monday's dinner..."
RESPONSE: [Detailed recipe]
```

### Function Calling

Think of function calling as giving your AI assistant access to specialized tools – like a nutritional calculator that knows the exact calorie content of every ingredient. [Function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) allows your AI to work with specific tools and APIs in a structured way, making it perfect for nutritional analysis. Instead of expecting the AI to perform complex nutritional calculations (or generate recipes from scratch!), you can define specific functions that the AI will recognize and request when appropriate.

1. **Define Functions:** Create function definitions
2. **Expose to AI:** Make function definitions available during interactions
3. **Handle Calls:** Execute functions when requested by AI
4. **Process Results:** Incorporate results into AI context

**Example function definition:**

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "calculate_nutrition",
        "description": "Calculates nutritional information for a recipe or ingredient list",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "ingredients": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "description": "List of ingredients with quantities",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {"type": "string"},
                            "quantity": {"type": "number"},
                            "unit": {"type": "string"}
                        }
                    }
                },
                "servings": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Amount of servings in the recipe."
                }
            },
            "required": ["ingredients", "servings"]
        }
    }
}
```

**Example function calling flow:**

```
AI OUTPUT: "[Recipe for Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl]"
AI FUNCTION CALL: calculate_nutrition(ingredients=[...], servings=2)
FUNCTION EXECUTION: Querying nutrition database for ingredients and calculating nutritional sum
FUNCTION RESULT: {"calories": 425, "protein": 12.5, "carbs": 48.3, "fats": 22.7}
AI PROCESSING: Evaluating nutritional values and comparing against user's nutritional targets
AI OUTPUT: [Recipe for Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl with complete nutritional information]
```

> Your application is required to perform all nutritional analysis using Function Calling.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Imagine combining the creativity of AI with the reliability of tested recipes. [RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) can significantly improve your recipe recommendations by combining the power of AI with a knowledge base of existing recipes. Instead of generating recipes from scratch (which may lead to hallucinations), RAG allows your system to:

* **Retrieve** relevant recipes from a database based on user preferences
* **Augment** the AI prompt with this retrieved information
* **Generate** customized recipes that are grounded in real, tested recipes

Improve recipe quality by combining AI with a knowledge base of recipes:

* **Document Storage:** Create a database with at least 500 recipes and 500 ingredients
* **Embedding Creation:** Convert recipes to vector embeddings
* **Retrieval Strategy:** Implement relevance-based search
* **Augmentation Technique:** Incorporate retrieved recipes into prompts

**Example RAG flow:**

```json
{
    "user_query": "high-protein vegetarian dinner",
    "retrieved_recipes": [
        {"id": "r123", "title": "Lentil Bolognese", "relevance_score": 0.89},
        {"id": "r456", "title": "Tofu Stir-Fry", "relevance_score": 0.76}
    ],
    "augmented_prompt": "Generate a high-protein vegetarian dinner recipe similar to these examples but customized for user who prefers Italian cuisine: [recipe_data_here]",
    "generated_result": "..."
}
```

> Scrape recipe data from public datasets, APIs with appropriate licensing, or  **generate with AI** .

## Feature Requirements

### Recipe management

Transform your app into a smart cookbook that knows exactly what each user wants and needs. Your recipe management functionality must include:

* **Search and Filtering:**
  * Search by name, ingredients, or cuisine
  * Filter by dietary restrictions, allergies, ingredients
  * Filter by calories, macros, preparation time
* **Recipe Details:**
  * Display ingredients, instructions, nutritional info
  * Visual representation of nutritional info

### Data Structures

To ensure accurate nutritional calculations and consistent recipe scaling, all measurements must be standardized to common units: solids in grams (g), liquids in milliliters (ml), energy in kilocalories (kcal), and time (duration) in minutes. This standardization is crucial for:

* Precise nutritional analysis across recipes
* Accurate portion scaling and serving size adjustments
* Consistent ingredient measurements for shopping lists
* Reliable function calling for AI calculations

While recipes may display friendly measurements for users (cups, tablespoons, etc.), the underlying data structure must maintain these standardized units.

At minimum, your **Recipe** and **Nutritional Information** JSON objects must include the following fields:

**Recipe:**

```json
{
    "id": "r789",
    "title": "Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl", 
    "cuisine": "Mediterranean",
    "meal": "lunch",
    "servings": 2,

          "description": "Combine cooked quinoa with vegetables, drizzle with dressing, and top with crumbled feta.", 
          "ingredients": ["ing123", "ing124", "ing125", "ing126", "ing127", "ing128"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Nutrient Information:**

```json
{
    "id": "ing321", 
    "label": "white rice",
    "unit": "gram",
    "quantity": 100,
    "nutrition": {
        "calories":370,
        "carbs": 81,
        "protein":6.2,
        "fats": 0.6
    }
}
```

### Nutritional Analysis

Effective nutritional analysis is fundamental to any successful meal planning application and for achieving set health goals. By providing clear feedback on nutritional intake with visualizations, you help users make informed decisions about their food choices and adjust their meals so they could achieve their goals.
At minimum, your nutritional analysis must include the following features:

* **Macro Tracking:**
  * Display calories (kcal) and macros (in grams and % of daily target) per meal/day.
  * Visualize macronutrient breakdown:
    * Interactive pie charts for nutrient breakdown per meal/day.
    * Progress bars for each macronutrient.
* **Goal Tracking:**
  * Compare nutritional intake against goals:
    * Daily progress towards calorie targets
    * Weekly averages vs. targets
    * Deficit/surplus calculations
  * Visualize progress indicators:
    * Progress bar toward calorie targets
    * Color-coded deficit/surplus indicators (red/yellow/green)
    * Trend lines showing daily caloric deficit/surplus during a week/month
* **AI-Driven Analysis:**
  * Nutritional highlights summary:
    * Key achievements according to users health goals ("Remained in caloric deficit for 5 days in a row!")
    * Potential concerns ("Caloric deficit was more than 500kcal 3 days out of 5!")
    * Macronutrient balance analysis
  * Improvement suggestions:
    * Specific food recommendations
    * Meal timing adjustments
    * Portion size modifications
    * Alternative ingredients for better macronutrient balance
    * Weekly meal plan optimizations

### Cross-Feature Integration

Cross-Feature integration is important for cohesive and seamless user experience. Data should be asked only once and flow seamlessly between different features of the application.

**Your nutritional analysis features have to be integrated to relevant features already created:**

* Daily progress tracking is accessible from the Health Dashboard
* Detailed historical analysis is available in the Progress Charts section
* AI-powered suggestions appear alongside other health insights
* All visualizations follow the established design system for consistency and familiarity

**You are required to make use of minimally these previously created features to further personalize the users meal planning experience:**

* Use BMI and weight goals to calculate calorie targets
* Apply activity level to adjust portions and macros
* Filter recipes based on health data
* Update wellness score based on nutritional intake
* Use nutrition data to refine health insights

## Important Considerations ❗

* **AI Model Selection:** You might consider the following aspects:
  * Nutritional Accuracy
  * Format Consistency
  * Context length
  * Cost and latency
  * Customization needs

> You may find that different models excel at different tasks within your application. For example, you might use one model for creative recipe generation and another for precise nutritional analysis.

Your meal planning features must integrate:

* **Prompt Engineering:**
  * Use few-shot examples
  * Apply iterative refinement
  * Use sequential prompting
* **Parameter Optimization:**
  * Temperature (creativity vs. predictability)
  * Top-p (diversity control)
  * Max tokens (response length)
* **Error Handling and API Reliability:**
  * Implement graceful handling for API issues
  * Create clear user-facing error messages
  * Build recovery mechanisms for failed requests
* **Content Management:**
  * Implement version control for meal plans
  * Consider collecting user feedback for personalization
